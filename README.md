# PythonShell

Project description

1. Wrote a simple shell in Python programming Language
2. Implemented three built-in functions which would be executed in the current shell. (including: list all running and stopped background jobs, change a stopped job into running background job or into running foreground job)
3. Created a new process to load and run commands other than built-in functions
4. Designed signal handlers to deal with situations where user hits ctrl-C (terminate the foreground job), ctrl-Z (stop the foreground job) and when a child process terminates (reap the child process)
5. Designed the signal masks carefully to avoid miscellaneous race conditions
